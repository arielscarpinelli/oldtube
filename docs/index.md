# OldTube

If your Samsung Smart TV removed the YouTube app from your SmartHub after the June 30 of 2017, you can install this replacement app.

## Installing on 2011/2012 firmware 

If your SmartHub looks like this

- Press the `Smart` button in your remote
- Press `A` button in the remote for opening login (or press `Tools` botton, then select "Login"). If you are already logged in with your personal account, use the same steps to logout first.

- Set it to `45.33.74.131`. Use the remote numeric buttons and advance with the right arrow. When you are done, press the `Return` button.

- The TV should show a progress indicator downloading the app. If an error appears, verify that you correctly set the IP address.

- After the install is complete, select "Complete" and press the `Return` button twice to go back to the SmartHub. You will have now the OldTube icon in your installed apps.

## Installing on newer firmware 

I believe you should still have the YouTube option available. If you don't please contact me so I can update these instructions. Meanwhile you can follow the pattern from [here](http://developer.samsung.com/tv/develop/legacy-platform-library/d20/index) or [here](http://developer.samsung.com/tv/develop/legacy-platform-library/art00121/index), setting up my app server IP `45.33.74.131`
